TODO:
- Make graph justifying the random seed
- Tuning alpha (likelihood parameter)
	o Make graph for various alpha, what is MSE for various?
	o Ks_squared or KS, alpha=.5,1,2,3,4,5
- Once alpha is tuned, find “average” MSE vs Samples plot, with and without stochastic conditioning. (Might need the “average” MSE because the variance might be high)
- Analyze what is the effect on the posterior with the new observation model? Look at the posterior for, say theta[11] when IS samples = 100
- Parallelize MCMC (is this possible?)
- Parallelize BBVI (is this possible?)
- Make SMC correctly sequential (resample after each reaction)
- Double check MCMC and SMC likelihood is correct
- Get best possible results without stochastic conditioning
	o IS
	o BBVI
	o SMC
	o MCMC
- Get best possible results for IS with stochastic conditioning (needs alpha tuned)
	o IS (for sure)
	o BBVI
	o MCMC
	o SMC (probably not, since parallelizing might not be possible)
- Compare results with and without stochastic conditioning  
- Tune IS and SMC prior with BBVI or MCMC and get new results, see if improved
- BBVI ELBO plot, with and without stochastic conditioning. WandB plots for BBVI for SMC with and without stochastic conditioning, see if there is an improved ELBO convergence with different hyperparameters. 
- Write the paper
- Prepare the presentation 

To put in paper
-	Justify not integrating out the randomness of the simulator (read pseudo marginal methods)
Today: 
-	What about a different number of paths?? Is KS the same if I use 10k paths instead of 1k?
